        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fried rice is one of my all time favorite dishes to cook when I want to make something deliciously satisfying in a pinch. This recipe super simple, super tasty,
            and extremely wallet friendly, so why not give it a try!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garilc, rough mince</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, finely sliced</li>
            <li>3-4 green onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>2-3 cups cooked rice</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp all purpose soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp MSG</li>
            <li>1 tsp white pepper, fresh cracked</li>
            <li>225 grams protein of choice</li>
            <li>Lime wedges and cucumber slices for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a carbon steel skillet or wok heat 2 Tbsp of oil over high heat. Once hot and slightly smoking add your protein and flash fry for 2-3 minutes just to get a bit of color, our goal is not to fully cook the protein yet. Cut the heat and place the protein in a bowl to add later.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat back to high and bring the rest of the oil to a bare smoke. Add the vegetables and fry until they're lightly charred.</li>
            <li>Add the rice, protein, and the soy sauces now, then toss/mix everything to combine. Keep tossing over high heat until the rice grains are well toasted.</li>
            <li>Plate with green onions to garnish with a lime wedge and cucumber slices on the side. Enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
