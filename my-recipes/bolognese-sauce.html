        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>1 Large Onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 Carrots, diced</li>
            <li>3 Celery Stalks, diced</li>
            <li>6 Cloves of Garlic</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp Double Concentrated Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
            <li>1 tsp Dried Thyme</li>
            <li>Parmigiana Reggiano</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Half a bottle of red wine</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of Cream</li>
            <li>1 Lb of Pasta</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Water, as needed</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Roughly dice the onions, carrots, celery, and garlic.</li>
            <li>In a food processor or blender, pulse the vegtables until they are a similar texture to the ground beef.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat a large pot of medium heat and add 3 tbsp of olive oil. When the oil is hot add the processed vegtables and saute until all of the moisture has been cooked out and they start to brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the meat to the pot and break it down into small bits. Keep sauteing the meat and vegtables until the moisture is cooked off and a fond begins to develop on the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Once there is a light fond, add the tomato paste and cook for 5 minutes or until a deep brown (NOT BLACK/BURNT) fond has covered the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>At this point add the wine to the pot to deglaze. Stir with a wooden spoon and scrape up all that gloarious fond. Cook until wine is reduced by half.</li>
            <li>Now add the bay leaves, thyme, and enough water to cover the meat. Over medium heat bring this to a simmer, then lower the heat to low and cook for 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>30 minutes before the sauce is done, get a pot ready to boil pasta in.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, remove the herbs from the sauce and add the cream and parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining and combine the sauce with the pasta on low heat, using pasta water to bind the sauce to the pasta as needed.</li>
            <li>And just like that the dish is complete! Get ready to dig into an amazing pasta with bolognese sauce!</li>
